The PhonePe Pulse Github repository is a treasure trove of diverse metrics and statistics waiting to be unlocked. This project aims to harness the power of this data, extracting, processing, and visualizing it in a user-friendly manner. The solution seamlessly integrates scripting, data transformation, database management, and interactive visualization to deliver insightful and visually appealing dashboards.

## Technologies Used
- Streamlit: A Python library for creating interactive web applications with minimal effort.
- Plotly: Used for creating dynamic and visually appealing plots and charts on the dashboard.
-SQL Database: Utilized for storing structured data for further analysis.
-Git: Employed for version control, enabling collaborative development and easy management of codebase changes.

## Libraries Used
- streamlit
- pandas
- plotly
- os


## Approach
## Data Extraction:
The GitHub repository has ben cloned using Git and the data is converted to store it in a suitable format like CSV or JSON.

## Data Transformation:
Data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing has been done.

## Database Insertion:
After the data transformation proceee the data is migrated to MySQL database

## Dashboard Creation:
Interactive dashboard has been created using Streamlit and Plotly, incorporating Plotly's geo map functions.

## Data Retrieval:
The data is mysql is converted to Pandas dataframe, dynamically updating the dashboard.
